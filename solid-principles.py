# The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.”
# These concepts were later built upon by Michael Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym.
# And in the last 20 years, these five principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming,
# changing the way that we write software.

# Martin and Feathers' design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.
# Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!
